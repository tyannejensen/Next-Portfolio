What do developers like more than learning? Problem solving and stream-lining
processes, effectively.

When it comes to writing content for the web, Markdown has been a favorite
amongst developers and content creators due to the simplicity and ease of use.

But, what if you could enhance Markdown by combining the power of React
components to restructure the way you present your data?

We present you with the answer: MDX.

## So....What is MDX?

Think of MDX as the secret weapon for developers who love both simplicity and
power.

At its core, MDX is a file format that combines the best aspects of Markdown and
supercharges them JSX. This allows for the ability to embed interactive React
components, pull in dynamic data, write inline JSX, and craft rich, engaging
documents in Markdown.

```
export async function getSource() {
  const response = await fetch('https://portfolio-2p4n.onrender.com/');
  const data = await response.json();
  return data;
}
```

## MDX - Why?

its 2025, we aren't settling for mediocre this year. So why settle for basic,
when you can have brilliance?

MDX isn't just another tool-it's **THE** tool. The missing link between static
content and interactivity. It takes the simplicity of Markdown and injects it
with the limitless power of React, making your documents more dynamic, engaging,
and down right impressive.

We all like that **WOW** factor, don't we?

<Counter />

### Here are some of the ways MDX is taking over:

- **Reusable Components** - Imagine writing once and using that content
  _everywhere._ With MDX, you can drop in React components like buttons, charts,
  and interactive elements (like the one above) before you even finish that
  first cup of coffee.
- **Dynamic Content** - We live in 2025 now, your content shouldn't be stuck in
  the past. MDX allows for real-time updates based on state, props, or API
  data-so your documents evolve just as you, your data, and your projects do.
- **Better Collaboration** - We all know that you take charge in your group
  projects, so let's make things easier for ourselves, okay? Developers and
  content creators, unite! Writers can focus on crafting Markdown, and the
  developers can sprinkle in components for a seamless, enhanced experience.
- **Effortless Integration** - MDX is a team player, and it works beautifully
  with Next.js and Gatsby, making it easy to bring its magic into your existing
  projects. Say goodbye to those boring README.md files. We are bringing life to
  our projects in all the ways.

## Let's Start

Now, if you have made it this far - **_welcome to the team!!_** Let's get
started! Thankfully, this setup is easier than debugging that CSS issue at 2 AM.
(Are you feeling called out yet?)

### Step 1: Installation

_I wanted it, so I got it._ Lets install this wonderful tool.

🛠 If you're using **Next.js**, run:

```
npm install @next/mdx @mdx-js/loader
```

🚀 For **Gatsby**, use:

```
npm install gatsby-plugin-mdx @mdx-js/react
```

Boom. The power is now at your command.

## Step 2: Configure MDX

_Now, lets make sure your project actually knows how to use this tool._

🛠 For **Next.js**, update your next.config.js:

```
const withMDX = require('@next/mdx')();
module.exports = withMDX({
  pageExtensions: ['js', 'jsx', 'md', 'mdx']
});
```

🚀 For **Gatsby**, tweak your gatsby-config.js:

```
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    'gatsby-plugin-mdx'
  ]
};
```

PHEW! With this setup, MDX is locked and loaded. Time to have some fun!

## Step 3: Write your first MDX File!

This is the **best** part! Create a `.mdx` file and start mixing Markdown with
JSX (or TS if you prefer) like a _PRO_.

```
# Welcome to MDX

This is a standard Markdown paragraph.

<MyComponent />

Here's some **bold text** and a list:
- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3
```

Yes, you literally embed a React component inside Markdown. Welcome to the
future.

🛠 If you're using **Next.js**, run:

```
npm install @next/mdx @mdx-js/loader
```

## How to use MDX

To use MDX, you need to install a plugin for your static site generator or build
tool. For example, if you're using Gatsby, you can use the `gatsby-plugin-mdx`
plugin to enable MDX support in your project.

Once you have the plugin installed, you can start writing MDX files by creating
files with the `.mdx` extension and writing JSX inside them.

## Conclusion

MDX is a powerful tool that allows you to write JSX in your Markdown files. This
post has introduced you to the basics of MDX and explained why you might want to
use it in your projects.
